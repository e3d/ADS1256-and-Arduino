# ADS1256-and-Arduino

This is a library for interfacing the ADS1256 with an Arduino UNO/MEGA (though it likely works with others)

It builds on my existing library for the Teensy 3.1/3.2: https://github.com/mbilsky/TeensyADS1256

There is a demo video explaining how it used on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/xZ4ib39RXb0

More details about the ADS1256 in my original video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjLwvXKz2x8
